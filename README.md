# Multi-Threaded Shell - 2020
This is the project code for several low level simulating projects, all written in C:
1. Shell with program executing functionality and piping
2. Threading library
3. Thread local storage
4. Virtual disk file system 
These projects were all done for the Introduction to Operating Systems class in my undergrad. All of these programs together allow you to simulate a Unix shell/file system and create virtual disks.
